# feedback_form
Website feedback form I created using Anvil, a full-stack web app builder that only uses python. 
Sends user feedback to database hosted on Anvil server.

To quickly get started, follow [this link](https://anvil.works/build#clone:FIQC5HL5MGIODASO=SZDLPDBMB4S73CN4PEFNJNBN)
to create a clone of it in Anvil.

Follow [this link](https://anvil.works/docs/uplink) to use this code outside of Anvil.
